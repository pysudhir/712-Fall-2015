## README ##

The current directory contains 2 directories
1. leveldb: Contains modified leveldb source code
2. ycsb-0.1.4: Contains modified ycsb

How to start?
1. leveldb has been built in ubuntu-12.04. You might want to build this again.
   Quite a few things have to be changed if you want to execute this in MAC. Let me know if needed
- Go to ./leveldb
- make clean
- make

2. You might have to rebuild native code corresonding to YCSB extension of leveldb
- Go to ./ycsb-0.1.4/leveldb-binding
- Run ./run.sh
- Optionally use ./ycsb-0.1.4/leveldb-binding/delete_database.sh to delete database
- DB gets created at ./ycsb-0.1.4/sampledb 
- run.sh does not load/execute workloads. Please read last few lines of run.sh for instructions to load/execute workloads
